2. Identify Primary Keys

authors: id, name
books: id, title, isbn
categories: id, name
members: id, name, email
library_cards: id, card_number




3. Establish table relationships
One-to-One: Each member can have one library card, each library card belongs to excactly one member.

One-to-Many: An author can write many books, but each book has only one author.

Many-to-Many: Books can belong to multiple categories, and categories can contain multiple books. We'll use a join table for this relationship.
